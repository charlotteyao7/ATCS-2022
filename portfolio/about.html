            <h1>Hi! I'm Charlotte Yao.</h1>
            <p>
                I am a senior at Menlo School in Atherton, California, and I am self-taught artist. I've never taken an official
                art course so my experience is largely experimental. I enjoy watercolor, acrylics, and line art, but my all-time
                favorite medium is color pencil. I love the control I have when I hold the pencil, and I find the process of layering
                and burnishing very theraputic. Whenever I am overwhelmed with school work, I sit down at my desk with my color
                pencils and draw something that inspires me. My subjects mostly include nature and food, and I try to capture their
                detailed textures.
